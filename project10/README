                           Project 10 - Compiler I: Syntax Analysis

README- This file.
jackAnalyzer.py- it's a syntax analyzer that parses Jack programs according to 
the Jack grammar, producing an XML file that captures the program's structure.


Remarks
-------
We builded the jackAnalyzer in 2 stages: the first was the tokenizer-it's a 
program that breaks a given textual input into a list of separate tokens. Then
the second stage was to build the parser-that goes over the tokenized text and 
emits output indicating that it "understood" the text's grammatical structure.
